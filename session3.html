    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;">Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to
        reduce your risk
        of <strong>infections</strong> when they
        cough, sneeze or speak. Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors. The further
        away, the better.<br>
        Make <u>wearing a mask</u> a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and cleaning
        or
        disposal are essential to make masks as effective as possible.
        Here are the basics of how to wear a mask:
        <u>Clean your hands</u> before you <ins>put your mask</ins> on, as well as before and after you take it off, and
        after you
        touch
        it at any time.<br>
        Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.
        <mark style="background-color: darkorange;">When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every
            day either wash it if it’s a fabric
            mask,
            or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.</mark>
        Don’t use masks with valves.
        For specifics on what type of mask to wear and when, read our Q&A and watch our videos. There is also a Q&A
        focused on masks and <em>children.</em>
